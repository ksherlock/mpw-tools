MPW Tools
=========

This is a collection of tools for use with the MPW emulator.

Some of them are replacements for built-in MPW commands.  Some of them are 
replacements (the original Duplicate, for example, has a graphical 
confirmation box). Some are just handy to use.

These are tested under the MPW emulator.  They may or may not actually work
with a real MPW installation due to implementation differences.
